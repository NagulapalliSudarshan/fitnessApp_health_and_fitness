<p>Many people strive to be fit. Fitness, after all, is synonymous with health.Having a high level of overall fitness is linked with a lower risk of chronic disease, as well as a better ability to manage health issues that do come up. Better fitness also promotes more functionality and mobility throughout one’s life span.And in the short term, being active can help your day-to-day functioning, from better mood to sharper focus to better sleep.    </p>
<h2> What It Means to Be Fit</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cardiorespiratory Fitness</strong> : <br> Your VO2 max is a commonly used measure of this. It’s your body’s ability to uptake and utilize oxygen (which feeds all of your tissues), something that is directly related to your health and quality of life, says Abbie Smith-Ryan, PhD, professor and director of the Applied Physiology Laboratory at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Musculoskeletal Fitness</strong> : <br> This includes muscle strength, endurance, and power</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Flexibility </strong> : <br> This is the range of motion of your joints.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Balance</strong> : <br> This is your ability to stay on your feet and steady to avoid falls.</li>
    </br>
    <li><strong>Speed </strong> : <br>  This is how quickly you can move</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<h2>Health Benefits of Exercise</h2>
<p>improved fitness drastically reduces the risk of chronic diseases that develop over time, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and even cancer. “The one thing that will help prevent almost any type of disease is fitness,” says Grayson Wickham, DPT, CSCS, founder of Movement Vault, a mobility and movement company in New York City.</p>
